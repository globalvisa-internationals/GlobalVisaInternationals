                    {/* --- The Hook: Context & Urgency --- */}
                    <p><strong>The spires of Prague are timeless, but the window to visit them is narrowing.</strong> As the heart of the "Central European Triangle" (Prague-Vienna-Budapest), the <strong>Czech Republic</strong> has become a top-tier destination for 2026. From the Charles Bridge at sunrise to the fairytale streets of Český Krumlov, the Bohemian allure is undeniable.</p>
                    <p>However, the <strong>Czech Republic Schengen Visa</strong> is notoriously rigorous. With high demand comes stricter scrutiny. The Consulate requires more than just a flight booking; they demand a cohesive travel narrative. A misunderstood itinerary, a "dummy" hotel booking, or a bank statement that doesn't align with your profession can lead to immediate rejection.</p>
                    <p><b className={styles.strong}>Global Visa Internationals (GVI)</b> provides specialized visa consulting for discerning travelers in Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi. We manage the bureaucratic complexities so you can focus on your Bohemian itinerary.</p>

                        <p>For our clients, a rejected visa isn't just a stamp—it's a disrupted holiday and a mark on their travel history. We replace "hope" with "precision."</p>

                            <li><b className={styles.strong}>VFS Appointment Strategy:</b> Securing a slot at VFS Global for the Czech Republic is currently the biggest hurdle in India. We monitor the appointment grid 24/7 to secure your biometrics submission slot the moment it opens.</li>
                            <li><b className={styles.strong}>The "Central Europe" Logic Check:</b> Most travelers visit multiple countries (e.g., Czechia, Austria, Hungary). We audit your itinerary to ensure you are legally applying at the Czech Embassy under the "Main Destination Rule," preventing a jurisdictional rejection.</li>
                            <li><b className={styles.strong}>Financial Portfolio Structuring:</b> We analyze your ITRs, mutual funds, and bank statements to prove "Strong Economic Ties" to India—the #1 factor Visa Officers look for to ensure you will return.</li>
                            <li><b className={styles.strong}>Customized Cover Letters:</b> We draft professional narratives that explain nuances like freelance income, recent job changes, or gap years, proactively answering the officer's questions before they ask them.</li>

                    <p>A common error for travelers visiting Prague, Vienna, and Budapest is applying at the wrong embassy. You must apply for a <b className={styles.strong}>Czech Republic Schengen Visa</b> ONLY if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The Czech Republic is your <b>sole destination</b>.</li>
                        <li>You are visiting multiple countries, but you are spending the <b>highest number of days</b> in the Czech Republic.</li>
                        <li>You are spending an equal number of days in each country, but the Czech Republic is your <b>first point of entry</b> into the Schengen zone.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><i><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> If you fly into Prague but spend 3 days there and 6 days in Austria, you MUST apply at the Austrian Embassy. We verify your day-wise itinerary to prevent rejection due to "Wrong Jurisdiction."</i></p>

                    <p>Even financially secure applicants face rejections. Here are the "Pro-Level" checks we perform to protect your application:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>"Dummy" Hotel Bookings:</b> The Consulate validates reservations. Using "pay later" bookings that auto-cancel before your visa is processed is a guaranteed rejection. <em>Solution: We assist with verifiable accommodation vouchers.</em></li>
                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>Unexplained Cash Deposits:</b> A sudden deposit of ₹3 Lakhs just before printing your bank statement looks suspicious (labeled as "funds parking"). <em>Solution: We help you structure your finances to show organic savings.</em></li>
                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>Vague "Sightseeing" Plans:</b> Writing "Touring Prague" for 7 days is insufficient. <em>Solution: We create a detailed day-wise itinerary mentioning specific castles, transport links, and tours.</em></li>
                    </ol>

                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>What is the Czech Republic visa processing time?</b> The official processing time is 15 calendar days. However, during the peak summer season (May-August), this can extend to 30-45 days. We recommend applying at least 2 to 3 months in advance.</li>
                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>Can I visit Germany or Austria with this visa?</b> Yes. A valid Czech Republic Schengen Visa allows you to travel freely across all 29 Schengen countries, provided your main destination remains the Czech Republic.</li>
                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>Do I need to visit the VFS center in person?</b> Yes, all applicants (12 years and older) must visit the VFS center to submit biometrics (fingerprints and photo). We guide you through this process.</li>
                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>How much bank balance is required?</b> We generally recommend a closing balance of ₹2.5 Lakhs to ₹4 Lakhs per person, with a disposable income history that justifies the trip cost.</li>
                    </ul>
