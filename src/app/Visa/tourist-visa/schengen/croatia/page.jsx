                    {/* --- The Hook: Context & Urgency --- */}
                    <p><strong>The Adriatic is calling, but the borders are stricter.</strong> With Croatia now fully integrated into the <strong>Schengen Zone</strong> and the Eurozone, it has become one of the most desirable destinations for 2026. From the walled city of Dubrovnik to the waterfalls of Plitvice, the allure is undeniable.</p>
                    <p>However, this new status means the <strong>Croatia Tourist Visa</strong> application is no longer a simple formality. The documentation standards now match the rigor of Switzerland or Germany. A vague itinerary, insufficient travel insurance, or a booking that cannot be verified can lead to an instant rejection—jeopardizing not just your summer holiday, but your future ability to enter Europe.</p>

                    <p>Many travelers unknowingly apply at the wrong embassy. You must apply for a <b className={styles.strong}>Croatia Schengen Visa</b> specifically if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Croatia is your <b>only destination</b>.</li>
                        <li>You are visiting multiple Schengen countries (e.g., Croatia, Slovenia, Italy), but you are spending the <b>maximum number of days in Croatia</b>.</li>
                        <li>You are spending an equal number of days in each country, but your <b>first point of entry</b> into the Schengen zone is Croatia (Zagreb, Split, or Dubrovnik).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><i><strong>Pro-Tip:</strong> Applying for a Croatia visa when you plan to spend 5 days in Zagreb and 10 days in Paris will lead to a rejection for "Wrong Jurisdiction." We verify your itinerary to prevent this error.</i></p>

                    <h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Why Are Croatia Visas Rejected? (And How We Avoid It)</h2>
                    <p>Even wealthy travelers face rejections due to technical errors. Here are the top "Pro-Level" insights we use to protect your application:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>Unverified Accommodations:</b> The Consulate checks hotel bookings. If you use "Pay at Hotel" options that get auto-cancelled before the visa is processed, you will be rejected. <em>Solution: We assist with confirmed, verifiable vouchers.</em></li>
                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>The "Sudden Funds" Trap:</b> Depositing a large sum of cash (e.g., ₹2 Lakhs) into your account one week before applying is a major red flag. <em>Solution: We help you structure your statement to show organic savings or proper sponsorship.</em></li>
                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>Vague Day-wise Plans:</b> Writing "Sightseeing in Dubrovnik" for 5 days is insufficient. <em>Solution: We provide a detailed itinerary mentioning specific tours, transport, and logic for the stay.</em></li>
                    </ol>

                        <li><b className={styles.strong}>What is the Croatia visa processing time in India?</b> The standard processing time is 15 calendar days.
