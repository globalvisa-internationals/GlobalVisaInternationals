          <h2 className={styles.subTitle}>Applying for Europe Business Visas: Your Pathways to Opportunity</h2>
          <p>Navigating the various routes for Europe Business Visas can seem daunting due to the multiple countries and their unique policies, but we're here to simplify it. The most common programs for entrepreneurs and investors seeking to establish a presence in Europe include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Schengen Business Visas (Short-Stay):</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Primarily for short business trips (up to 90 days within a 180-day period) for meetings, conferences, market research, or negotiations within the Schengen Area. Not for establishing long-term residency or running a business.</li>
                <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Invitation letter from European company, proof of business purpose, travel itinerary, financial solvency, return ticket, travel insurance.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>National Business/Entrepreneur Visas (Long-Stay/Residence Permits):</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>These are specific to individual European countries and are designed for non-EU citizens who wish to establish and operate a business, work as a freelancer, or engage in self-employment. They often lead to a residence permit and, eventually, permanent residency.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>German Residence Permit for Self-Employment:</strong> Requires a viable business plan, sufficient funds, and demonstration of economic benefit to Germany.</li>
                    <li><strong>French Entrepreneur Visa (Visa Long Séjour Créateur d'entreprise):</strong> For innovative projects, often requiring support from French incubators or significant investment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Netherlands Startup Visa:</strong> For innovative startups, requiring collaboration with a recognized facilitator in the Netherlands.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spanish Entrepreneur Visa:</strong> Part of the "Entrepreneurs Law," for innovative entrepreneurial activities of special economic interest.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Requirements (General):</strong> Detailed business plan, proof of financial resources, relevant business experience, local integration plan, health insurance.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Golden Visa / Investment Residency Programs:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Offered by several EU countries (e.g., Portugal, Greece, Spain, Malta, Cyprus) to attract foreign investment. These programs grant residency in exchange for significant investments in real estate, capital transfers, job creation, or purchasing government bonds. They usually offer a pathway to permanent residency and citizenship.</li>
                <li><strong>Examples:</strong>
                  <ul>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Digital Nomad Visas:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>While not strictly "business visas" for establishing a local business, some European countries offer visas for remote workers/freelancers who operate their business from outside the country but reside within it (e.g., Croatia, Estonia, Germany, Portugal, Spain).</li>
                <li><strong>Requirements:</strong> Proof of income from outside the country, health insurance, often an online business model.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
