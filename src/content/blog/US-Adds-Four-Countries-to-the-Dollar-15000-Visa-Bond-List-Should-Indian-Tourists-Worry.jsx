                        The United States has tightened its visitor visa policies by expanding the <b>Visa Bond Pilot Program</b>, adding four additional countries where travelers may be required to post up to <b>$15,000</b> as a refundable bond before entering the U.S.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This move has sparked international discussions. But what does it mean for <b>Indian tourists</b>, and why has the U.S. implemented this policy now? Let's explore.

                    <h3 className={Styles.subtitle}> What Is the US Visa Bond Program?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The <b>US Visa Bond Pilot Program</b>, introduced during the Trump administration, allows consular officers to require certain <b>B-1/B-2 visa applicants</b> to deposit a monetary bond. This acts as a guarantee that they will comply with visa rules and leave the U.S. on time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The refundable bond ranges from <b>$5,000 to $15,000</b>. While intended to reduce overstays, critics argue that this policy disproportionately targets developing nations, emphasizing financial deterrents over efficient immigration processes.

                    <p>As of October 2025, the program includes seven countries, primarily in Africa. The four newly added are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🇲🇱 Mali</li>
                        <li>🇲🇷 Mauritania</li>
                        <li>🇸🇹 São Tomé and Príncipe</li>
                        <li>🇹🇿 Tanzania</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>They join the previously listed countries:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🇬🇲 The Gambia</li>
                        <li>🇲🇼 Malawi</li>
                        <li>🇿🇲 Zambia</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Starting October 23, 2025, travelers from these nations applying for B-1/B-2 visas may need to post a bond before visa issuance.

                    <h3 className={Styles.subtitle}> Why Has the US Introduced This Policy?</h3>
                    <p>
                        The U.S. claims the policy targets countries with high visa overstay rates. The bond encourages compliance, reduces illegal overstays, and serves as a pilot to test financial mechanisms for immigration control.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, many observers note that this policy reflects a continuation of restrictive Trump-era practices, prioritizing control and deterrence over fairness, transparency, and collaboration in global travel.

                    <h3 className={Styles.subtitle}>🇮🇳 Should Indian Tourists Be Worried?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Short answer: <b>No.</b> India is not included in the visa bond list. Indian citizens applying for <b>B-1/B-2 visas</b> are not required to post any bond, keeping the process simple and accessible.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> India maintains strong compliance with U.S. visa rules, showing consistently low overstay rates.</li>
                        <li>The bond policy currently applies only to the seven African nations listed above.</li>
                        <li>Any changes to include India would require official notice from the U.S. Department of State.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        India’s adherence to visa regulations is a model for responsible international travel — a lesson the U.S. could learn instead of relying primarily on financial deterrents.

                    <p>
                        This policy echoes Trump-era "America First" immigration practices, where visa regulations became harsher and additional fees targeted non-immigrant travelers, including Indians. Yet Indians contribute billions to the U.S. economy through education, technology, and tourism.
