          <p>Basava Jayanti is observed in remembrance of the birth anniversary of Shri Basavanna by Lingayats, predominantly in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Maharashtra. Shri Basavanna, a revered 12th-century Hindu Kannada poet and philosopher, founded the Lingayat religion and championed significant social reforms.</p>
          <p>Shri Basava (also known as Basaveshwara or Basavanna, 1134–1196 AD) was born on the third day of the Vaisakha month of the Anandanama (Samvatsara) in 1134 A.D. This pivotal event marked the beginning of a new era, known as the 'Basava Era'. Even today, many panchangas (Hindu calendars) incorporate the Basava Era count directly from Basavanna's birth. In 2020, the Basava Shake was 879, and people often refer to the year as the 'Basava Era' or 'Basaveshwara Era'.</p>
          <p>Shri Basavanna was born in a village called Bagewadi, near Bijapur in Karnataka. He was the son of Madarasa and Muktamba. His father was a Jain priest and a devotee of Lord Shiva. Basavanna's early life was marked by a deep spiritual inclination, and he later became a prominent figure in the Lingayat sect, which emphasizes devotion to Lord Shiva.</p><p>Shri Basava was a profound social reformer and philosopher who fearlessly combated deep-rooted social ills prevalent in society, such as the rigid caste system and meaningless ritualistic practices within Hinduism. He passionately advocated for a way of life where the personal experience of God was central, asserting that caste, social status, and gender held no special significance in one's spiritual journey. Basavanna firmly believed in a caste-less society where every individual had an equal opportunity to progress in life.</p>

          <p>Basava was a true humanitarian. He not only preached but also practiced and propagated new ideals of humanitarianism, emphasizing compassion, fraternity, and democracy. To strengthen this noble mission, he envisioned the Anubhava Mantapa – an academy of Lingayata saints, mystics, and philosophers. This unique institution served as a wellspring of ideas centered on shared human values and ethics.</p>

          <p>The most significant achievement of Basavanna was the establishment of "Anubhava Mantapa" – The Hall of Spiritual Experience – which was, in essence, an open parliament. Remarkably, this was a pioneering concept in world history, introducing the idea of a deliberative assembly. The principles of Glasnost (openness) and Perestroika (restructuring) were taught and implemented by Basavanna in the 12th century, centuries before these terms gained modern prominence. Basava was a strong proponent of the monotheistic belief in a formless God, Shri Shiva, which formed the bedrock of his movement.</p>

          <p>The concept of Kayaka, meaning work, was elevated by Basavanna to be synonymous with Kailash – Heaven. He envisioned an ideal society where everyone had an equal opportunity for religious endeavor and spiritual growth, regardless of their profession. He sought to transform the prevailing social mindset that judged a person's worth based on their occupation. He declared that no profession was inherently superior or inferior; rather, honesty and sincerity in one's work determined its merit, a principle he termed 'Kayaka'.</p>
          <p>In Karnataka, the Lingayat community constitutes a significant portion of the population, with approximately one in every five individuals adhering to this faith. In the major districts of North Karnataka, including Vijapura, Dharwad, and Belagavi, nearly every other person is a Lingayat. Significant Lingayat populations are also present in the neighboring districts of Kalaburagi, Raichur, Bidar, Bagalkot, and Ballari. Historical accounts from figures like Madara Chennaiah, Kembhavi Boganna, Kondaguli Keshiraja, and Jedara Dasimayya suggest that the Lingayatha Dharma existed long before Basavanna's emergence.</p>
          <h3 className={Styles.subtitle}>Basava Jayanti Celebrations: A Vibrant Homage to Shri Basavanna</h3>
          <p>Basava Jayanti, a highly significant festival in Karnataka and a revered occasion for the Lingayat community across South India, is deeply rooted in propagating the transformative message of the 12th-century social reformer and philosopher, Shri Basavanna. The core of the celebration revolves around his teachings, primarily the pursuit of an egalitarian society free from social hierarchies and discrimination. Celebrated annually on the third day of the month of Vaisakha according to the Hindu calendar, this auspicious day marks the birth anniversary of Basavanna, a pivotal figure in Indian history and philosophy. The observance is marked with immense enthusiasm, devotion, and communal harmony throughout Karnataka, as well as in significant Lingayat populations in Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh.</p>
          <p>The celebrations on Basava Jayanti are multifaceted and deeply meaningful. Devotees make special visits to Shri Basaveshwar temples, dedicated to Basavanna, to offer their prayers and respects. A central aspect of these visits is the recitation of Basava Vachanas, the powerful and insightful poetic expressions of Basavanna's philosophical and social teachings. These Vachanas encapsulate his wisdom on topics ranging from devotion and ethics to social justice and the dignity of labor.</p>
          <p>Beyond temple visits, Basava Jayanti is characterized by numerous social and cultural activities organized by the Lingayat community and various organizations. These often include community gatherings, processions, and charitable events. A common practice is the exchange of sweets and greetings among people, fostering a spirit of camaraderie and goodwill. The underlying message of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (world brotherhood), a key tenet of Basavanna's philosophy, is actively promoted and reinforced during these interactions.</p>
          <p>Exclusive cultural and spiritual events form an integral part of the Basava Jayanti celebrations, particularly within the precincts of Basavanna temples and community centers. A highly anticipated and spiritually enriching moment is listening to the Swamiji's enlightening discourses. These speeches delve into the profound aspects of Basava's philosophy, providing detailed explanations and contemporary examples of how his principles can be applied in modern life. Topics such as spiritual democracy, the pursuit of peace, and the importance of brotherhood are often central themes, underscoring the enduring relevance of Basavanna's guidance in today's world.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, in some regions, especially in Karnataka, processions featuring the portrait or idol of Shri Basavanna are organized, accompanied by traditional music and devotional singing. Educational programs and seminars on Basavanna's life and teachings are also common, aiming to disseminate his message to a wider audience, including the younger generation.</p>
          <p>The essence of Basava Jayanti celebrations lies in reaffirming the values championed by Shri Basavanna – equality, compassion, hard work, and spiritual enlightenment. It serves as a reminder of his significant contributions to social reform and his vision for a just and harmonious society. It is our collective hope that each Basava Jayanti will inspire us to revisit and actively implement the timeless wisdom of Shri Basavanna, fostering spiritual democracy, cultivating peace, and strengthening the bonds of brotherhood in the diverse world we inhabit.</p>

          <h3 className={Styles.subtitle}>Vachanas of Shri Basavanna</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>"Make your body the temple of God." - Basavanna Teachings:</strong> This isn't just about physical health; it's a powerful metaphor. Basavanna emphasizes the sanctity of the human body as the vessel where the divine resides. It calls for treating oneself with respect and recognizing the inherent divinity within. This aligns with the Lingayat concept of Ishtalinga, the personal representation of Shiva worn on the body.</li>
            <li><strong>"Earn wealth through honest and truthful work." - Principles of Basavanna:</strong> This Vachana underscores the dignity of labor (Kayaka). Basavanna stressed that honest work, regardless of its nature, is a path to spiritual merit. It rejects exploitation and emphasizes ethical means of livelihood. True wealth, in his view, is earned through integrity.</li>
            <li><strong>"Live morally. Do not aspire for other’s wealth, women, and gold." - Basava's Ethical Code:</strong> This is a fundamental ethical guideline promoting contentment, integrity, and respect for others. It cautions against greed, lust, and envy, which Basavanna saw as hindrances to spiritual progress and social harmony.</li>
            <li><strong>"Never lose heart while pursuing the path of trust. Live a principled life." - Wisdom of Basavanna:</strong> This Vachana encourages perseverance and unwavering faith in righteous conduct. The path of truth and integrity may be challenging, but Basavanna urges followers to remain steadfast and live according to their principles.</li>
            <li><strong>"Have faith in the creator of this universe; believe that he is omnipresent and the Supreme power." - Basavanna's Beliefs:</strong> This highlights Basavanna's monotheistic belief in Shiva as the ultimate reality, present everywhere. This faith forms the foundation of his spiritual teachings.</li>
            <li><strong>"My actions go one way, another way my speech! Look, Shri, there is no trace of purity in me! Where action fitting to the word is found, there, truly, Shri Kudala Sangama dwells." - Vachana by Basavanna:</strong> This is a deeply personal and introspective Vachana. Basavanna acknowledges the common human struggle with hypocrisy – the gap between words and deeds. He emphasizes that true devotion and the presence of the divine (Shri Kudala Sangama, his deity) are found where there is congruence between one's actions and speech.</li>
            <li><strong>"Listen, O Shri of the meeting rivers, things standing shall fall, but the moving ever shall stay." - Basava Vachana Meaning:</strong> This Vachana uses the powerful imagery of flowing rivers meeting to convey the idea of dynamism and the impermanence of stagnation. It suggests that progress, change, and continuous effort are essential for enduring, while rigidity leads to decay.</li>
            <li><strong>"There is no hell or heaven somewhere else; hell is right here when you are dishonest. Heaven is right here when you conduct yourself with honesty and truthfulness." - Basavanna on Morality:</strong> Basavanna demystifies the concepts of heaven and hell, bringing them into the realm of present human experience. Our actions and character in this life determine our "heaven" or "hell." Honesty and integrity create a positive inner state (heaven), while dishonesty breeds suffering (hell).</li>
            <li><strong>I"In a brahmin house where they feed the fire as a god, when the fire goes wild and burns the house, they splash on it the water of the gutter and the dust of the street, beat their breasts and call the crowd. These men then forget their worship and scold their fire, O Shri of the meeting rivers!" - Social Commentary by Basavanna: </strong>This Vachana is a sharp critique of ritualistic practices that lack genuine understanding. Basavanna uses the analogy of fire worship to highlight the hypocrisy of those who revere something in a controlled setting but abandon their reverence when it becomes inconvenient or harmful. It questions blind faith without reason.</li>
            <li><strong>"If one helps someone without whole-heartedness, if one gives a donation to show off, then it is not truly helping or giving. If you give with your willingness, without expecting anything in return, that is true giving. The Shri will bless such actions." - Basavanna on True Giving:</strong> This Vachana emphasizes the importance of sincerity and selfless intention in acts of charity and help. True generosity stems from compassion and a genuine desire to assist, not from a desire for recognition or reward.</li>
            <li><strong>"When the bee sucks honey, it does not destroy the flower, but gathers its sweetness. The good man acts similarly in society."</strong> - This Vachana beautifully illustrates how one should interact with the world – taking what is needed without causing harm and contributing positively to society.</li>
            <li><strong>"The rich build temples for Shiva. What can I, a poor man, do? My legs are pillars, my body the shrine, my head the golden cupola."</strong> - This Vachana emphasizes that devotion is not dependent on material wealth. The body itself can be a temple for the divine, highlighting the accessibility of spirituality to all.</li>
            <li><strong>"Do not be deceived by the outward appearance. The husk may look grand, but the kernel is what matters."</strong> - This Vachana cautions against judging by superficial appearances and emphasizes the importance of inner substance and true worth.</li>
            <li><strong>"Like a fish out of water struggles and dies, so does a person without devotion."</strong> - This Vachana powerfully conveys the essential nature of devotion in one's life, comparing it to the life-sustaining element for a fish.</li>
            <li><strong>"The tongue is like a double-edged sword; it can kill or it can heal. Choose your words wisely." </strong>- This Vachana highlights the immense power of language and the responsibility that comes with it. It advocates for mindful and compassionate communication.</li>
