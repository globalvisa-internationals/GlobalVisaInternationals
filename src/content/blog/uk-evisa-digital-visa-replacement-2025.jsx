            <h2 className={Styles.subtitle}>1. UK Goes Digital: Transition to eVisas for Non-EU Work, Study, and Mobility Routes</h2>
            <p>
              The UK Home Office is ushering in a new era of digital immigration, moving away from traditional physical visa stickers (vignettes) to a streamlined electronic visa (eVisa) system. This significant transformation, which began in April 2024 with the phasing out of Biometric Residence Permits (BRPs), will culminate on <strong  className={Styles.subtitle}>June 15, 2025</strong>, when the issuance of physical vignettes will cease for many non-EU visa categories.
            </p>

            <h3  className={Styles.subtitle}>Overview of Changes</h3>
            <p>
              Effective June 15, 2025, non-European nationals applying for specific UK visa categories will no longer receive a physical sticker in their passport. Instead, their visa status and conditions will be recorded electronically and accessible through their UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) account. This digital shift aims to enhance security, efficiency, and convenience for both applicants and border authorities.
            </p>

            <h3  className={Styles.subtitle}>Affected Visa Categories</h3>
            <p>
              The transition to eVisas will impact non-EU applicants for a wide range of visa types, including:
            </p>
            <ul  >
              <li>Skilled Worker (including Health & Care)</li>
              <li>Global Business Mobility</li>
              <li>Global Talent</li>
              <li>International Sportsperson</li>
              <li>Temporary Worker (Creative Workers & Government Authorized Exchange)</li>
              <li>Youth Mobility Scheme</li>
              <li>Student visas (including short-term visas up to 11 months)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              It's important to note that dependants, such as partners and children, will still receive a 90-day physical vignette initially, after which they will transition to an eVisa if extending their stay.
            </p>

            <h3  className={Styles.subtitle}>The New Application Process</h3>
            <p>
              Upon approval, the process for successful applicants will be entirely digital:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>An approval email will be sent, instructing them to create or link their existing UKVI account.</li>
              <li>Identity verification will be completed through secure methods like passport uploads, biometrics, or the ID Check app.</li>
              <li>The eVisa, an electronic record of their immigration status and conditions, will be securely linked to their passport.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              This system empowers users to view their status online, generate share codes for verification with employers or landlords, and update their personal information conveniently.
            </p>

            <h3  className={Styles.subtitle}>Benefits of the eVisa System</h3>
            <ul  >
              <li><strong>Enhanced Security and Convenience:</strong> Eliminates the risk of lost or damaged physical documents and provides 24/7 online access to visa status.</li>
              <li><strong>Improved Border Control:</strong> Leveraging biometric data, the digital system strengthens fraud prevention and accelerates border checks.</li>
              <li><strong>Greater Efficiency:</strong> Reduces administrative delays associated with physical documents and allows for quicker updates to UKVI records.</li>
              <li><strong>Accessible Services:</strong> Authorised organisations like the NHS and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) can securely verify visa status through system checks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3  className={Styles.subtitle}>Potential Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <p>
              While the benefits are clear, the transition may present challenges:
            </p>
            <ul  >
              <li><strong>Digital Exclusion:</strong> Concerns exist for individuals with limited internet access or digital literacy.</li>
              <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> Initial rollouts have seen some system glitches, including identification errors.</li>
              <li><strong>Transition Deadlines:</strong> With BRPs expiring by December 31, 2024, a large number of individuals will need to transition to eVisas promptly.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The Home Office is committed to addressing these challenges by providing 24/7 helplines, carrier support, and assisted digital services for vulnerable applicants.
            </p>

            <h3  className={Styles.subtitle}>Key Dates to Remember</h3>
            <ul >
              <li><strong>April 2024:</strong> Transition invitations began for BRP and BRC holders.</li>
              <li><strong>December 31, 2024:</strong> All physical BRPs expire; eVisas become mandatory for BRP holders.</li>
              <li><strong>June 15, 2025:</strong> Transition to eVisas for all key non-EU visa holders.</li>
              <li><strong>July 15, 2025:</strong> All new work and study visa applicants will receive eVisas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3  className={Styles.subtitle}>Guidance for Employers and HR Teams</h3>
            <p>
              Employers and HR professionals must adapt their practices to the new digital landscape:
            </p>
            <ul  >
              <li>Update right-to-work policies to incorporate share-code checks through UKVI, replacing physical document verification.</li>
              <li>Proactively communicate with existing staff holding BRPs to ensure they create UKVI accounts before their documents expire.</li>
              <li>Prepare for potential recruitment delays during the transition period and ensure adequate support for affected employees.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3  className={Styles.subtitle}>Recommendations for Visa Holders</h3>
            <p>
              To ensure a smooth transition, visa holders are strongly advised to:
            </p>
            <ul >
              <li>Create or actively maintain your UKVI account, especially if you hold a BRP or BRC, and complete the transition before the expiration date.</li>
              <li>Link your current passport to your UKVI account and generate share codes in advance of any travel, onboarding, or renting needs.</li>
              <li>Keep your personal details, including passport information and contact details, up to date on your UKVI account.</li>
              <li>Prepare for potential technical issues by having backup documents (e.g., screenshots, printed share codes) and utilize support lines if necessary.</li>
              <li>Stay informed by regularly monitoring UKVI communications for any changes or updates regarding deadlines and support services.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3  className={Styles.subtitle}>Conclusion: Embrace the Digital Future with Confidence</h3>
