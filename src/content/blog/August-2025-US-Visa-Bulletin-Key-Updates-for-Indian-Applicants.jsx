                    <section>
                        <p>The U.S. Department of State has released the August 2025 Visa Bulletin, providing important updates for family-sponsored and employment-based green card applicants. If you are an Indian applicant waiting for your U.S. green card, here’s everything you need to know in simple terms.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><b>Family-Sponsored Green Card Updates for India</b>
                                <ol>
                                    Family-based green cards allow U.S. citizens and Green Card holders to sponsor their close relatives for permanent residency in the United States. These visas are divided into four preference categories (F1–F4), and each category has different waiting times depending on demand and your priority date.

                                    <li><b>Final Action Dates (India)</b></li>
                                    <p>The Final Action Date is the most critical date in the Visa Bulletin for Indian applicants. It indicates when a green card can actually be issued. If your priority date is earlier than the listed date, your green card can finally be approved.</p>
                                    Let’s break it down category by category for August 2025:

                                    <b>F1 – Unmarried Sons and Daughters of U.S. Citizens</b>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Final Action Date: 15 July 2016</li>
                                        <li>If you are the unmarried adult child of a U.S. citizen, and your priority date is before July 15, 2016, your case is now eligible for a green card.</li>
                                        <li>Estimated wait time: Around 9 years for Indian applicants.</li>
                                        <p className={Styles.note}>The F1 category is very slow, and the backlog is almost a decade for Indian applicants.</p>
                                    </ul>

                                    <li><b>F2A – Spouses and Minor Children of Green Card Holders</b>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Final Action Date: 01 September 2022</li>
                                            <li>This category is highly favorable right now. If you are a Green Card holder in India sponsoring your spouse or unmarried children under 21, your family can receive green cards very quickly.</li>
                                            <li>Estimated wait time: Around 2–3 years, which is extremely short compared to other categories.</li>
                                            <p
                                                className={Styles.note}>Highlight:<li>This is the fastest-moving family category for Indians.</li>
                                                <li>If you are a permanent resident, now is the best time to sponsor your spouse or minor children.</li></p>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>

                                    <li><b>F2B – Unmarried Adult Children of Green Card Holders</b>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Final Action Date: 15 October 2016</li>
                                            <li>This category is for unmarried children (21 or older) of Green Card holders.</li>
                                            <li>If your priority date is before October 15, 2016, your case is now current for final processing.</li>
                                            <li>Estimated wait time: About 9 years.</li>
                                            <p className={Styles.note}>The F2B category is very slow, similar to F1, and families often wait nearly a decade.</p>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>

                                    <li><b>F3 – Married Sons and Daughters of U.S. Citizens</b>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Final Action Date: 01 August 2011</li>
                                            <li>If you are the married child of a U.S. citizen, your case will only move forward if your priority date is before August 1, 2011.</li>
                                            <li>Estimated wait time: Around 14 years or longer.</li>
                                            <p className={Styles.note}>Note: This is one of the slowest categories for Indians. Applicants who started in 2011 are only now getting approvals.</p>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>


                                    <li><b>F4 – Brothers and Sisters of U.S. Citizens</b>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Final Action Date: 01 November 2006</li>
                                            <li>This category is for siblings of U.S. citizens.</li>
                                            <li>Only those with a priority date earlier than November 1, 2006 can now receive a green card.</li>
                                            <li>Estimated wait time: A staggering 18–19 years.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>

                                    <p className={Styles.note}>The F4 category is heavily backlogged. If you are sponsoring a brother or sister from India, be prepared for a very long wait.</p>
                                </ol>
                            </li>


                            <h3>Overall Key Highlights for Indian Applicants</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li><b>F2A is the most favorable category</b> – Green Card holders can bring spouses and children with minimal delay.</li>
                                <li>F1, F2B, and F3 are slow, with 8–14 year waits.</li>
                                <li>F4 (siblings) has an 18–19 year backlog, making it the longest wait time for Indian families.</li>
                                <li><b>Action Tip:</b> If you are eligible under F2A, file as soon as possible to take advantage of the short wait.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h2><li>Employment-Based (EB) Green Card Updates for India – August 2025</li></h2>
                            <p>Employment-based (EB) green cards are issued based on professional skills, education, or investment in the U.S. They are divided into five main categories (EB-1 to EB-5). Each category has a Final Action Date (when a green card can be issued) and a Date for Filing (when you can submit your application to USCIS or the National Visa Center).</p>
                            <ol>
                                <h2><li>Final Action Dates (India)</li></h2>
